# cafe

- Imagine you are running a cafe. Create a new Python file in your folder called cafe.py.
- Create a list called menu, which should contain at least 4 items in the cafe.
- Next, create a dictionary called stock, which should contain the stock value for each item on your menu.
- Create another dictionary called price, which should contain the prices for each item on your menu.
- Next, calculate the total stock worth in the cafe. You will need to remember to loop through the appropriate dictionaries and lists to do this.
- Finally, print out the result of your calculation
